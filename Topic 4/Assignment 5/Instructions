PROBLEM STATEMENT
Update the BSTree code that you have to read in data from an input file and 
create and traverse the Binary Search Tree. Your driver will accept a file 
specified by the user (argv), and produces output based on the following 
operations in a text file:
• Any line of the file that starts with a # is a comment – ignore
• Create tree: C
• Clear tree: X
• Delete tree: D
• Insert word: I word
• Find word: F word
• Remove word: R word
• Get word: G word
• Show number of nodes in the tree: N
• In-order print: O
• Reverse in-order print: E

PSEUDOCODE
Submit and get pseudocode approved for the driver software (what runs your game) 
before coding it. You do NOT need to submit pseudocode for the linked list code.

SUBMIT
• A driver
o Takes input file specified by the user (argv)
o Pointer to the binary search tree to be used to create instances, work with 
instances, and destroy instances
o Helper functions as needed to input file, process the input file, execute the 
commands received from the input file, and produces output.
• Word class containing the following members and functions (used by the driver)
o word – string contain the word assigned to the Word instance
o count – an unsigned int (defaults to 1) containing the count of the number of 
instances the “word” was encountered in the input
o default constructor
o overloaded constructor, with string parameter (representing the “word”)
o destructor
o gets and sets
• Binary search tree node with the following: NOTE: This is a template class
o data - a template data type
o left child – a pointer to another search tree node
o right child – a pointer to another search tree node
o overloaded constructor – NULLs out both pointers, assigns value to data
o destructor
o gets and sets as appropriate
• Binary search tree with the following
o root – points to a binary search tree node (do NOT implement public get or 
set functions for this member)
o size – unsigned int
o default constructor – set root pointer to NULL and node count to zero
o destructor – use to clear to free all memory
o gets and sets as appropriate
